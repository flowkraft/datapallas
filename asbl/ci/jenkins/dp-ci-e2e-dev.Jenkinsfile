// Job datapallas/dp-ci-e2e-dev. The DEVELOPMENT e2e: dp-ci.sh e2e-dev. One spec file (E2E_SPEC required), web or electron-linux target, and it never rebuilds the package:
// it runs on the package that is there (reuse) or packages only the content again (content). Not a release check: that is dp-ci-e2e.
// The work is the plain script named below, run on the host over SSH exactly as it is run by hand; this file
// only starts it and shows its log. The run is a detached container owned by the Docker daemon, so closing
// the browser or restarting Jenkins never stops it (see asbl/ci/jenkins/jenkins.md).
